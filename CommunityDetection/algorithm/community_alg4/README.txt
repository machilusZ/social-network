Compile using "make".

The program takes two arguments, a user id and and output file. To run on facebook user 698 (for example), type

./cluster facebook/698 results.out

This will use the appropriate files (facebook/698.feat, facebook/698.edges, etc.), and write the results to results.out.

To modify various parameters of the experiment being run, see the main function.
